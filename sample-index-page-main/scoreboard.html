      <h2 class="section-title">The Megaboard Project™: Because Size Does Matter</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        The Highland Park community has once again found itself divided; this time over a proposed
        district initiative known unofficially as <strong>The Megaboard Project™</strong>, a plan
        to replace the already massive football stadium scoreboard with a new model rumored to be
        visible from space.
      </p>

      <p>
        The question at the center of the controversy:
        <br><br>
        <strong>Do students really need paintbrushes when the current scoreboard is practically shrinking before our eyes?</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>The Scoreboard War Begins</h3>

      <p>
        “At some point we must ask ourselves,” said HP dad <strong>Todd Wexler</strong>,
        “how can our boys compete if visiting teams can&apos;t see the score in ultra-HD 12K
        resolution? It&apos;s humiliating.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Wexler later admitted he has not attended a full game since 2017 but insists
        “the principle matters.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, art students continue practicing in rooms described by one band member as
        “somewhere between a closet and a panic room.” A cellist reported that their music stand
        is held together with duct tape and “three generations of hope.”
      </p>

      <h3>The Proposed New Scoreboard Features</h3>

      <p>
        Parents advocating for the upgrade have released a wishlist, including:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>A <strong>360-degree rotating display</strong> “as God intended”</li>
        <li>A built-in <strong>smoothie bar</strong> for halftime hydration</li>
        <li>Live TikTok-style filters for players and cheerleaders</li>
        <li>Real-time stock updates “for parents who trade during games”</li>
        <li>A <strong>memorial flame</strong> dedicated to “every pass that should have been a touchdown”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        One booster club member insisted the screen must be “at least aquarium-sized,”
        then declined to clarify what that meant.
      </p>

      <h3>The Arts Push Back</h3>

      <p>
        Fine arts families argue the money should not go toward “a screen larger than
        the entryway at NorthPark Mall” and have proposed alternative investments such as:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Instruments that aren&apos;t older than some of the grandparents</li>
        <li>Theater lighting that doesn&apos;t actively buzz and flicker</li>
        <li>Art supplies purchased sometime after 2009</li>
        <li>Costumes not made entirely from unclaimed Lost &amp; Found items</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Choir director <strong>Ms. Hudgens</strong> also noted she would appreciate if the auditorium AC
        could be repaired before it becomes “a sauna of musical suffering.”
      </p>

      <h3>School Board Meeting Goes Sideways</h3>

      <p>
        The debate reached a boiling point at this week&apos;s school board meeting, where:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>A football dad wore a shirt reading <strong>“GO BIG OR DON&apos;T GO TO COLLEGE”</strong></li>
        <li>A band mom countered with <strong>“MICHELANGELO DIDN&apos;T NEED A JUMBOTRON”</strong></li>
        <li>A theater kid performed a dramatic monologue about institutional neglect</li>
        <li>Someone unveiled a scale model of the proposed scoreboard made entirely of Lululemon bags</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The meeting ended abruptly when the model fell over and crushed a trustee&apos;s Hydro Flask.
      </p>

      <h3>Financial Questions</h3>

      <p>
        Early estimates suggest the new scoreboard would cost:
      </p>

      <p><strong>More than the entire fine arts budget… and also more than the next three fine arts budgets.</strong></p>

      <p>
        A district spokesperson clarified that while the number is “sizable,” it&apos;s
        “nothing a few spirited fundraisers and three hundred thousand yard signs can&apos;t fix.”
      </p>

      <h3>Students Weigh In</h3>

      <p>
        Band students protested outside with hand-painted signs that read:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>“ART IS IMPORTANT TOO”</li>
        <li>“WE EXIST!”</li>
        <li>“WE STILL DON&apos;T HAVE ENOUGH CHAIRS”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, football players were reportedly neutral. One lineman commented:
      </p>

      <p>
        “I mean… bigger is cool. But also, can the art kids get chairs? Chairs seem basic.”
      </p>

      <h3>So… What&apos;s Next?</h3>

      <p>
        The school board is expected to vote next month. Until then, parents will continue arguing over
        whether:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Artistic expression should be nurtured</li>
        <li>Students deserve equitable support</li>
        <li>Or if a 200-foot scoreboard that can broadcast the game onto nearby houses is the true heartbeat of education</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For now, one thing is clear:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>In Highland Park, the arts matter, just not as much as looks, money or an LEDs the size of God.</strong>

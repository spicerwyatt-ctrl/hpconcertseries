    <p class="lead">
      Several Thanksgivings ago, a perfectly normal Highland Park attempt at deep-frying
      a turkey went very wrong very quickly. The details are less important than what
      came after: years of healing, quiet resilience, and now, a sponsored “glow-up”
      that the local paper has decided to call a miracle.

        <h3>What Actually Happened</h3>
        <p>
          Our subject, who requested partial anonymity (first name only, full face in every photo),
          sustained non-life-threatening but significant burns while helping a relative with a fryer.
          Recovery was long, boring, and very real.
        </p>
        <p>
          Friends remember her disappearing from group photos, turning down pool invites,
          and becoming gently obsessed with SPF 70.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The “Blessing” Part</h3>
        <p>
          After years of quietly managing appointments and insurance codes,
          she received a heavily discounted reconstructive procedure from a local surgeon
          who also offers “lunchtime lifts” and couples’ Botox packages.
        </p>
        <p>
          In exchange, she agreed to share her story in a glossy advertorial,
          framed as proof that sometimes tragedy is just “God redirecting you
          to a different jawline.”

          Maybe the real blessing is that she survived, found support, and can
          now decide what to do with her own face, regardless of how many
          med-spas try to tie a ribbon on it.

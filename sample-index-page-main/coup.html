      <h2 class="section-title">“If We&apos;re Taking Back the Country, We&apos;re Doing It in Nude Heels.”</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        After months of group chats labeled <em>“Bible Study,”</em> <em>“MomSquad,”</em> and suspiciously 
        <em>“Girls Trip Logistics,”</em> a coalition of Highland Park housewives has unveiled what they are calling 
        the <strong>HP Housewife Guide to Planning an Insurrection</strong>, a 32-page PDF that reads like a mix 
        between a Pottery Barn catalog and a coup attempt.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We&apos;re not saying we&apos;re overthrowing anything,” insisted group leader <strong>Meredith St. Clair</strong>, 
        wearing a pearl-encrusted sweater that read <em>“Moms for Freedom &amp; Frosé.”</em> 
        “We&apos;re just saying if democracy <em>were</em> to wobble, we&apos;d like to make sure the aesthetic isn&apos;t cheap.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The document begins with a foreword:
        <br><br>
        <strong>“If we&apos;re taking back the country, we&apos;re doing it in nude heels.”</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>1. Wardrobe Planning: “Revolution, But Make It Resort Casual.”</h3>

      <p>
        According to the guide, proper rebellion attire includes:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li><strong>White jeans</strong> (“symbolic purity &amp; slimming”)</li>
        <li><strong>Statement sunglasses</strong> (“for anonymity and vitamin D”)</li>
        <li><strong>Matching tote bags</strong> in tasteful beige</li>
        <li><strong>Blowouts</strong> (“history looks better when your hair does”)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        “People on the news looked so sweaty that day,” said <strong>Paige Montgomery</strong>, sipping an iced matcha. 
        “We can do better.”
      </p>

      <h3>2. Coordination: “It&apos;s Basically a Themed Charity Gala.”</h3>

      <p>
        The housewives insist theirs is not an insurrection — it&apos;s an 
        <strong>“elevated community gathering with light political undertones.”</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        “It&apos;s like Cattle Baron&apos;s Ball,” Paige said, “but with slightly more constitutional confusion.”
      </p>

      <p>
        They&apos;re designing:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>A custom <strong>step-and-repeat</strong></li>
        <li>A themed <strong>signature cocktail</strong> (“The Patriot-tini”)</li>
        <li><strong>Color-coded bracelets</strong> indicating brunch reservations afterward</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        “We already organize three charity galas, the school auction, and a neighborhood progressive dinner,” 
        Meredith said. “Running a tiny uprising can&apos;t be that different.”
      </p>

      <h3>3. Fitness Prep: “Core Strength for Core Values.”</h3>

      <p>
        Local barre studios have reported an uptick in bookings for women requesting the 
        <strong>“coup-ready package.”</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        “They keep saying things like ‘We need strong quads for the cause,’” said instructor Lexi, 
        who chose not to give her last name. “I don&apos;t know what that means and I don&apos;t want to.”
      </p>

      <h3>4. Social Media Strategy: “If You Don&apos;t Post It, Did You Even Revolt?”</h3>

      <p>
        The guide recommends:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>A coordinated <strong>Instagram dump</strong> (3 photos serious, 1 laughing, 1 of hands in a circle)</li>
        <li>A reel with dramatic piano music and slow zooms</li>
        <li>Matching captions like <em>“Fighting for what matters ✨”</em></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        They also advise carrying portable ring lights “in case lighting conditions reflect poorly on the movement.”
      </p>

      <h3>5. Snacks: “Revolution Runs on Charcuterie.”</h3>

      <p>
        The document dedicates an entire chapter to snacks:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>mini croissant sandwiches</li>
        <li>gluten-free flag-shaped cookies</li>
        <li>“artisan grapes”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        “People on the news were eating sad vending machine food,” said Meredith. “We refuse tragedy.”
      </p>

      <h3>6. Their Actual Political Plan: “Unclear.”</h3>

      <p>
        When asked what exactly they intend to accomplish, the group offered a range of answers including:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>“Fixing America&apos;s vibe”</li>
        <li>“Stopping whatever is happening to the cost of avocados”</li>
        <li>“Making brunch great again”</li>
        <li>“Putting God back in Pilates”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        No one referenced any branch or mechanism of government.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We&apos;re not… like… <em>political political</em>,” Paige clarified. “We&apos;re supportive. And photogenic.”
      </p>

      <h3>7. Conclusion: “History, But Elevated.”</h3>

      <p>
        Despite the dramatic branding, the group stresses they are not planning a real insurrection.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It&apos;s metaphorical,” Meredith insisted. “A vibe. A movement. A lightly themed empowerment experience. 
        Like SoulCycle but with founding fathers.”
      </p>

      <p>
        As of press time, the group was last seen arguing over whether the revolution should have a color palette 
        or a “seasonal direction.”

      <h2 class="section-title">Highland Park&apos;s Bold New Plan: Reading, Cancelled.</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        In a bold escalation of the 2014 Highland Park book ban, a coalition of highly motivated parents
        has announced a new initiative: <strong>Book Ban 2: Electric BookBanaloo</strong>, a sweeping effort
        to remove not just controversial novels, but <em>every single written word</em> from district life.
      </p>

      <p>
        The movement, operating under the slogan <strong>“Keep &apos;Em Safe From Letters”</strong>, argues that
        written language has &quot;gone too far&quot; and now poses, in their words, 
        &quot;an intellectual risk to growing minds.&quot;
      </p>

      <p>
        “First it was inappropriate passages. Then it was entire books,” explained committee co-chair 
        <strong>Charissa Bonnard-Lively III</strong>, addressing reporters outside a child-friendly pilates studio. 
        “Now we&apos;ve realized the real threat is the alphabet itself.”
      </p>

      <h3>Anything With Words Must Go</h3>

      <p>
        The new policy targets:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Books and e-books</li>
        <li>Audiobooks (&quot;the words are invisible but still dangerous&quot;)</li>
        <li>Board games with written instructions</li>
        <li>Juice boxes with text on the back</li>
        <li>Subtitles, captions, and closed captioning</li>
        <li>All student essays, worksheets, and sticky notes</li>
        <li>Teacher emails and any memo longer than three emojis</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In classrooms, traditional textbooks are being replaced with:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Large printed emojis</li>
        <li>Sticker charts and star systems</li>
        <li>A single laminated picture of a cowboy the district believes is &quot;historically neutral&quot;</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When asked how students will learn to read, one parent clarified: 
        “We&apos;re not against knowledge. We&apos;re against letters that could lead to ideas that could lead to opinions.”
      </p>

      <h3>The New Literacy Standard: Pictures Only</h3>

      <p>
        Under the revised curriculum, grades K–12 will transition to a 
        <strong>pictures-only academic model</strong>. Writing utensils other than crayons are being phased out. 
        Students may express themselves through drawings, interpretive hand gestures, and 
        what the handbook calls “vibe-based communication.”
      </p>

      <p>
        High school English has been rebranded as:
      </p>

      <p><strong>Advanced Coloring &amp; Symbol Interpretation (Honors)</strong></p>

      <p>
        Instead of writing essays, students will now:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Stare at a single illustration of a horse</li>
        <li>Describe the &quot;energy&quot; of the horse aloud</li>
        <li>Receive participation credit for &quot;emotional engagement&quot;</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Parent Reaction: Overwhelming Support</h3>

      <p>
        Many parents have applauded the decision.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I haven&apos;t read a book since 2006,” said one father. “This finally puts me on the same page as my kids.
        Actually—no pages. No pages at all.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Another parent praised the move for protecting students from “the dangers of adjectives,”
        which she described as “too emotional and frankly disrespectful.”
      </p>

      <p>
        One concerned mother did ask how students would apply to college without being able to read or write.
        The committee reassured her that “colleges will simply understand.”
      </p>

      <h3>Critics Speak Out (Illegally)</h3>

      <p>
        Several teachers attempted to raise concerns but were immediately escorted out for violating
        the new <strong>No Words Ordinance</strong> by accidentally forming sentences.
      </p>

      <p>
        One teacher tried to write a protest message on the whiteboard. The marker was confiscated, 
        and the teacher is now limited to finger painting.
      </p>

      <h3>What&apos;s Next?</h3>

      <p>
        Committee leaders say Phase Three of the initiative may involve banning:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Thought</li>
        <li>Subtext</li>
        <li>Punctuation-shaped jewelry</li>
        <li>Cloud formations that “look like letters”</li>
        <li>Numbers (&quot;math is just letters doing cosplay&quot;)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For now, Highland Park students will navigate a brave new world—one without nouns, verbs,
        or the tyranny of phonics. In place of a written mission statement, the committee issued a 
        wordless graphic:
      </p>

      <p><strong>“🖼️✨🙅‍♂️📚”</strong></p>

      <p>
        Translation: <em>We did not think this through.</em>

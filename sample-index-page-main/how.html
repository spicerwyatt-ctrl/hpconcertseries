        <p class="lead">
            This project began with initial ideation, followed by creating the posters that set the visual tone. After that, I built the website and developed the Instagram page to extend the project into a digital space. Once those were complete, I printed and distributed fliers at the Snider Plaza Tree Lighting by placing them on cars throughout the area. I then emailed news outlets while adopting the persona of a concerned Highland Park housewife and posted a corresponding fake alert on Nextdoor to expand the narrative. The project culminated when I received a response from a major news outlet.

        <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
        <p>
          My creative process centers on using whatever digital or physical tools I have in ways that are both shocking and meaningful. My work is almost always comedic; whether provocatively or simply through its own absurdity. I expose the strangeness of everyday life, from a statue of water guns drenched in fake blood that critiques school-shooting culture to a neighborhood hoax revealing how communities ignore mental-health struggles for the sake of appearance. I highlight the absurd through the absurd.
        </p>
        <p>
My practice is satirical and unsettling; I prefer a joke that builds tension rather than releases it. Influenced by Dadaism and the remixing of pop culture, my works are highly conceptual and layered, often combining multimedia and physical design elements that intentionally juxtapose and disrupt one another.
        </p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>“The HP Concert Series” is a multimedia project that utilizes social media, graphic design, web design, and culture jamming techniques to hoax a town in such a way that highlights how affluent neighborhoods discuss mental health, public disturbances, and appearance. This project uses parody, cultural acupuncture, and media hoaxing to examine how affluent towns and media discuss, or ignore, mental health, public disturbances, and appearance. This project uses provocation to get a reaction to start a conversation about mental health in these neighborhoods.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Key Take Aways</h2>
      <p>This project is about perception, not performance. While no one is actually booking John Hinckley Jr., the concept reveals how quickly a community reacts when its carefully curated image feels threatened. The posters serve as the initial disruption, and the website becomes a magnifying glass—pushing viewers deeper into the fiction while exposing how rumors solidify into “truth.” The polished, Highland Park–inspired aesthetics collide with absurdity and discomfort, turning the entire project into a piece of guerilla satire. Audience participationc(onfusion, panic, laughter, outrage) is not a bonus; it is the artwork itself.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this project isn’t about Hinckley at all. It’s about the community’s response to something unexpected entering its orbit. By blending clean design, hyper-local humor, culture jamming tactics, and fictional promotional materials, the work spotlights how fear, gossip, and moral judgment circulate in affluent spaces. It sits at the crossroads of suburban performance art, internet folklore, and neighborhood storytelling. The “concert” never happens, but everything around it does. The real event is the conversation it sparks.</p>

      <p>
I don’t live in your cul-de-sac, but I know every car in it. I play drums in real life and Photoshop in yours.
I put a concert where there is no concert, a crowd where there is no crowd, and a man on your windshield who will never take the stage.
I speak in posters, websites, and Nextdoor panic. I am not John Hinckley Jr., but without me, he never would have “played” Highland Park.
Who am I? I’m the artist who made this project.

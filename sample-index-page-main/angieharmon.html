    <h2 class="section-title">A Day That Never Was</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Highland Park residents woke up to disappointment this week when “Angie Harmon Day”
      — a proposed celebration of the actress, mother, and vague local legend —
      was officially canceled before a single banner could be ordered from FedEx Office.
    </p>

    <div class="split">
      <div>
        <h3>From Petition to Panic</h3>
        <p>
          The idea began, as all great suburban legislation does, in a Facebook group.
          One resident suggested a “fun, harmless little holiday” in which the town
          would honor Angie Harmon with a proclamation, a step-and-repeat wall,
          and a limited-edition Sprinkles cupcake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within hours, the comments devolved into a debate about parking, police
          presence, and whether the town should “also acknowledge other Angies, just to be inclusive.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The Official Statement</h3>
        <p>
          In a carefully worded email sent at 4:59 PM on a Friday, the town
          announced that Angie Harmon Day was being “postponed indefinitely”
          due to “unforeseen scheduling issues” and “an overabundance of enthusiasm
          that must be re-evaluated in committee.”
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>No refunds will be issued for pre-ordered commemorative tote bags.</li>
          <li>Residents are asked to refrain from flying Angie-themed yard flags “at this time.”</li>
          <li>The proclamation draft will be “kept on file” for the next 40 years.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">What We Learned</h2>
    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Celebrity Neutrality Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Town leadership insists the cancellation is part of a new “celebrity
          neutrality” stance: if they honor one TV star, they must honor them all.
          City staff estimate this would require <em>400+ parades a year</em>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Lawn Sign Economy</h3>
        <p>
          Several residents had already commissioned custom lawn signs reading
          “Honk for Angie.” These will now be repurposed for graduation season,
          homeowner anniversaries, or generic attention-seeking.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>The Real Legacy</h3>
        <p>
          In the end, Angie Harmon Day accomplished what few municipal holidays
          ever can: it gave the neighborhood something to argue about that
          wasn’t zoning, recycling bins, or whose dog left “evidence” on Armstrong.

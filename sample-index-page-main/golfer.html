        <p class="lead">
          In towns like Highland Park, golf isn’t just a sport, it’s a civic personality trait. A drive can be more than a swing, it’s a social barometer, a quiet referendum on confidence, risk, and who gets to walk back inside the clubhouse afterward like nothing happened. The fairway, in theory, keeps score. In practice, the town often does it for you.
        </p>

            <p>
              On Sunday evening, one ambitious golfer stepped up to the tee with a Callaway Paradym Driver and an audacity that bordered on inspirational poster territory. The ball, a glossy white Titleist Pro V1, was launched, promptly staging a rebellion against physics, strategy, and apparent communal stability.
            </p>

            <p>
              It wasn’t a collapse. It was a slice.
            </p>

            <p>
              The ball veered right in a trajectory so dramatic it could’ve authored its own third-act twist. It clipped a beverage cart, spooked a pair of geese, skimmed a sand trap like a stone across a lake, and disappeared off-course entirely, somewhere past the manicured limits of the park. The swing was singular. The consequence was apparently municipal.
            </p>

            <p>Within minutes:</p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>Conversations inverted like compasses at a magnet factory.</li>
              <li>Street names began sounding symbolic.</li>
              <li>Community apps buzzed like emergency radios despite no smoke being spotted, anywhere.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Nobody laughed, but they checked, nervously.
            </p>

            <p>
              That’s the thing about a bad slice on a perfect green: it never stays personal. It overshoots its origin. It asks everyone nearby to become an unintended witness, participant, or amateur ballistics analyst. The golfer may walk away telling the story later like an unlucky swing, but the town carries its consequences.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because ultimately, the metaphor holds:
            </p>

            <p>
              One bad drive doesn’t break the park… it breaks the illusion that the swing was ever yours alone.
            </p>

            <p>
              We stand by fairways hoping a miss can be contained. But sometimes the real slice isn’t in the air. The assumption that confidence equals control, and that risk taken in public will only ever belong to one person.
            </p>

            <p>
              Highland Park is fine, technically. The green still looks the same from a distance. The trouble with a ripple, after all, is not the size of the splash; it’s noticing, too late, that there was someone in the water.
            </p>

            <p><strong>
              All in all, this was a very disappointing day for Highland Park and deeply heartbreaking.

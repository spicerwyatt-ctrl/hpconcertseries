    <h2 class="section-title">The List Nobody Asked For</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Every house in Highland Park is technically “nice.” But some push through
      “nice” and land squarely in “architecturally Ambien.” We crunched the numbers
      (drove around once with iced coffee) to determine the ten most gloriously boring homes in town.
    </p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>#10 – Lexington Ave</h3>
        <p>
          Big? Yes. Personality? No. This house looks like it sells private equity and emotional repression. The windows are large, the vibe is small. Grade: B-. Energy: mouthwash corporate chic.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>#9 – Belfort Place</h3>
        <p>
          Mediterranean estate but somehow still tastes like unsweet tea. Absolutely massive, aggressively beige, and trying very hard to be European but was born in Dallas. Grade: A- for size, C for soul. Energy: Tuscan Olive Garden villain.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>#8 – Euclid Avenue</h3>
        <p>
          Respect your elders, unless your elders are this house, in which case absolutely dunk on it. Historic, huge, haunted by the ghosts of former decorators who were paid in exposure. Grade: A for architecture, F for flirting with millennial gray upgrades.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>#7 – Crescent Avenue 1</h3>
        <p>
          Absolutely enormous but somehow feels like it would shush you at a dinner party. The kind of house that puts tiny soap in every bathroom and expects applause. Grade: B+. Energy: soft piano music playing from unseen speakers.”
        </p>
      </div>
       <div class="card">
        <h3>#6 – Crescent Avenue 2</h3>
        <p>
          We’ve got half an acre of grass and 80 acres of audacity. Gorgeous, huge, and fully aware of it. Definitely owns 4 types of scissors for no reason. Grade: A. Energy: I flip houses for sport.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>#5 – Preston Road</h3>
        <p>
          Historic and gigantic and emotionally judgmental. Built in 1914, renovated every 6 months since. The house equivalent of saying “summer in the Hamptons” while holding a LaCroix. Grade: A-. Energy: I judge you but also host galas.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>#4 – Wade Barker Mansion</h3>
        <p>
          (Basically the Batman of HP mansions but Bruce Wayne gets his teeth whitened at Tom Thumb.) 16k square feet of legacy and exactly 4 square feet of humor. Grade: A+. Energy: absolute brass billionaire swagger.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>#3 – The Champion of Chill</h3>
        <p>
          Our winner boasts <em>three</em> garages, <em>zero</em> personality, and a lawn so
          uniform it might be rendered. It is the physical embodiment of
          “we let the builder pick everything.”

      The joke isn’t that these homes are bad; they’re not. The joke is that in a
      neighborhood this wealthy, even the wildest dreams somehow end up looking exactly the same.

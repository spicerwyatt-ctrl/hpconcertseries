    <p class="lead">
      Every house in Highland Park is technically “nice.” But some push through
      “nice” and land squarely in “architecturally Ambien.” We crunched the numbers
      (drove around once with iced coffee) to determine the ten most gloriously boring homes in town.

        <h3>#10 – The Spreadsheet</h3>
        <p>
          A home so perfectly symmetrical it feels like a before-photo in an
          interior design ad. Zero risks taken. Zero thoughts, just columns.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>#9 – The Beige Fortress</h3>
        <p>
          Miles of taupe stucco, two identical SUVs, and a front door that
          appears to lead directly into a tax bracket.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>#8 – The Tuscan Time Capsule</h3>
        <p>
          Built in 2014 but determined to be 2004 forever. Faux-stone arches,
          wrought-iron everything, and a wine cellar that has only ever seen pinot grigio.

        <h3>#7 – The Champion of Chill</h3>
        <p>
          Our winner boasts <em>three</em> garages, <em>zero</em> personality, and a lawn so
          uniform it might be rendered. It is the physical embodiment of
          “we let the builder pick everything.”

      The joke isn’t that these homes are bad — they’re not. The joke is that in a

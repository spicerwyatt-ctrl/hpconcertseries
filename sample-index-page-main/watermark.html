      <h2 class="section-title">“We Sent Him for a Wife. He Came Back With Bronzer.”</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        What was meant to be a spiritual reset for 19-year-old <strong>Hunter McAllister</strong>
        has instead left his conservative Highland Park parents “deeply confused, broadly humbled,
        and honestly… a little impressed,” after the young man returned from Watermark Church’s
        discipleship scene <strong>significantly gayer</strong> than when he left.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We sent him to Watermark to find God and a wife,” said Hunter’s mother, <strong>Stacey</strong>,
        clutching a leather-bound study Bible she mostly uses as décor. “But he came back with a sharper
        jawline, better posture, and a skincare routine that costs more than my car payment.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The McAllisters enrolled Hunter in Watermark’s young adult ministry, <em>The Porch</em>, after he
        was spotted in a cropped tank top at a lake trip, an outfit his father described as
        “theologically concerning.”
      </p>

      <h3>“They Called It Accountability. We’re Starting to Think It Was Choreography.”</h3>

      <p>
        Upon arrival, Hunter was assigned two “accountability partners,” which his parents assumed
        meant weekly Scripture memorization and masculine bonding over black coffee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, Hunter says he was introduced to:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>three former theatre majors who lead worship “with full body”</li>
        <li>a man who says “YAS Lord” unironically during praise breaks</li>
        <li>a small group leader whose bracelets outnumber his Bible translations</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        “We do talk about sin,” Hunter explained, “but we also talk about
        <em>lighting design</em> and <em>intentional layering</em>. Iron sharpens iron.”
      </p>

      <h3>“He Found God... and Also Contour.”</h3>

      <p>
        When Hunter returned home after several months of services, small groups, and emotionally
        intense worship nights, Stacey says she “felt the shift immediately.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “He walked through the door, dropped his duffel bag, and said,
        ‘Mother… I have been <em>transformed</em>,’” she recalled. “I thought he meant spiritually.
        But no. He meant his cheekbones.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Hunter now volunteers on the worship team and has started a side ministry consulting
        other young men on “Christ-centered personal style.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Watermark didn’t make me gay,” Hunter clarified. “They just gave me community, emotional
        vocabulary, and access to male role models who moisturize. Do you know what that does
        to a person?”
      </p>

      <h3>Parents Grapple With the “Unexpected Fruit” of Ministry</h3>

      <p>
        Hunter’s father, <strong>Brent</strong>, says he is grateful his son is in church
        but unsettled by the aesthetics.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m glad he’s reading Scripture,” Brent said. “But when he started quoting Psalms with a
        soft-launch Instagram carousel, I knew something had shifted.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Brent admits the family may have underestimated the influence of worship culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Everyone warns you about secular TikTok,” he said, “but no one prepares you for a
        6’1” worship leader in skinny jeans telling your son he’s ‘beautifully and wonderfully made’
        while playing minor chords.”
      </p>

      <h3>Church Responds: “We Can’t Control What the Holy Spirit Highlights.”</h3>

      <p>
        A fictional spokesperson for Watermark offered a statement:
      </p>

      <p>
        “We did not ‘make’ anyone anything. We simply provided biblical teaching, weekly small groups,
        and an environment where young adults can feel fully known and fully loved under
        high-quality LED stage lighting.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Another member added off the record:
      </p>

      <p>
        “If parents are worried their sons will become more expressive, compassionate, and
        well-accessorized, that’s really between them and the Lord.”
      </p>

      <h3>“God’s Plan Was Apparently Better Fitting Jeans.”</h3>

      <p>
        Despite her confusion, Stacey insists she’s trying to see the situation as part
        of a larger divine design.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Maybe this is just God humbling us,” she said. “We prayed for transformation.
        We just didn’t realize it might include a septum ring.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Hunter, for his part, seems at peace.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Honestly?” he said. “Watermark didn’t change who I am. It just gave me language for it,
        a church that kind of loves me, and a killer worship playlist.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He paused, then smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If anything,” he added, “they made me more honest. The gay part is just better lit now.”
